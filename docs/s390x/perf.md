# s390x Performance Status

Last updated: 2026-03-31 13:05:00 PDT

## Scope

This page tracks the current native s390x performance state after the branch
was frozen into three lanes:

- Lane A: build and stability only
- Lane B: promotable recorder-side iterator perf only
- Lane C: parked bridge and continuation research only

The current performance frontier is Lane B only. The bridge and continuation
line is parked unless the clean no-probe iterator baseline regresses
semantically again.

## Authoritative Validation Surfaces

- Primary perf host:
  - `kdz:/root/luajit2-s390x/perf-clean-20260330/repo`
  - machine type `8561` (`z15`)
- Regression screen host:
  - `zkd0:/root/luajit2-s390x/perf-clean-20260330/repo`
  - machine type `3906` (`z14`)

Validation rules:

- tracked-file sync only
- direct `src/` rebuild only
- same-host pinned `kdz` A/B is the policy signal
- `zkd0` is regression-only
- low-noise manual logs or debugger only
- no dirty-tree `iterator_probe.py` runs for perf decisions

Checked-in restamp helper:

- [tools/s390x/restamp_iterator_perf.py](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/tools/s390x/restamp_iterator_perf.py)
  now owns the authoritative iterator restamp path
- it syncs tracked files only, rebuilds directly in `src/`, captures both
  `jit.on` and `-joff`, runs the three focused micros, and writes:
  - `metadata.json`
  - `jit-on.jsonl`
  - `joff.jsonl`
  - `summary.md`
  - raw build, micro, owner-log, and IR-dump logs

Checked-in truth-pack helper:

- [tools/s390x/build_iterator_truth_pack.py](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/tools/s390x/build_iterator_truth_pack.py)
  now owns the focused frozen-baseline evidence pack
- it reuses the same tracked-file sync and direct `src/` rebuild path, then
  adds:
  - focused hot medians for value-only hash, key-using hash, and array
    value-only control
  - `-jdump=im` IR+mcode for the same three loops
  - low-noise owner logs
  - `jit.attach("trace")` and `jit.attach("texit")` counts after warmup
  - `perf stat` capture when the host supports those events

## Frozen Iterator Baseline

The current promotable iterator perf baseline is the four-piece recorder split
in [src/lj_record.c](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/src/lj_record.c):

- array visible numeric key comes from successor index:
  - `HIOP(trvk) - 1`
- non-array visible key stays lazy
- hash table live-in is trusted and read-only in `rec_isnext()` / `rec_itern()`
- non-array value lane is seeded from `ix.val` so the hash root trace no longer
  frame-source the visible value slot

This is a split policy, not a full-lazy collapse.

## Current Checkpoint Baseline

Frozen checkpoint branch:

- `k8ika0s/s390x-jit-on-freeze-20260331`

Latest checkpoint evidence:

- `kdz` truth pack:
  - `pairs_sum/hot median=0.060779`
  - `pairs_array_sum/hot median=0.066737`
- `zkd0`:
  - `pairs_sum/hot median=0.132097`
  - `pairs_array_sum/hot median=0.124149`

Current same-harness `-joff` comparator on `kdz`:

- `pairs_sum/hot median=0.005574`
- `pairs_array_sum/hot median=0.004126`

These are the numbers new iterator perf work must beat.

The earlier freeze-point reference is still useful as a historical anchor:

- `kdz`: `0.059818 / 0.061622`
- `zkd0`: `0.093881 / 0.087945`

But the measured branch-tip contract is now the post-cleanup restamp above,
not the older reference.

## Distance To Expectation

Current `kdz` JIT-on distance to same-harness `-joff`:

- `pairs_sum/hot`
  - JIT-on `0.060779`
  - `-joff` `0.005574`
  - gap `+0.055205s`
  - ratio `10.90x`
- `pairs_array_sum/hot`
  - JIT-on `0.066737`
  - `-joff` `0.004126`
  - gap `+0.062611s`
  - ratio `16.17x`

Delivery ladder from the current `kdz` restamp:

- Restamp bar:
  - still failed
  - hash `+1.61%` slower than the earlier freeze-point reference
  - array `+8.30%` slower than the earlier freeze-point reference
- Recovery bar:
  - hash target `<= 0.056341`, current gap `+0.004438s`
  - array target `<= 0.059806`, current gap `+0.006931s`
- First real-results bar:
  - hash target `<= 0.050000`, current gap `+0.010779s`
  - array target `<= 0.055000`, current gap `+0.011737s`

## What The Current Baseline Proved

- The branch is no longer blocked on the old late crash in dispatch helper
  errno handling.
- Array and hash do not pay the same owners.
- Array-side post-call numeric key-lane waste was reduced by deriving the
  visible numeric key from the successor index instead of rereading the helper
  tuple key lane.
- Hash-side eager visible-key and table-slot costs were both removed.
- Hash root traces no longer frame-source the visible value lane.
  - helper `VLOAD #0` now feeds the hash add path directly
  - the old extra frame value `SLOAD` is gone

## Current Owner Map

Low-noise manual logging and raw IR on the post-cleanup branch tip show:

- Value-only hash:
  - dominant shared payer is still `addov_rr_int_eq`
  - main non-value cluster is still the hidden `KEYINDEX` load
  - only other frame `SLOAD` is the carried total slot
  - helper `VLOAD #0` feeds the visible value lane directly
- Key-using hash:
  - still pays shared `addov_rr_int_eq`
  - still pays the hidden `KEYINDEX` load
  - adds a visible key/type `SLOAD`
- Array value-only control:
  - still pays shared `addov_rr_int_eq`
  - still pays numeric-key control loads

Current read:

- shared `addov_rr_int_eq` is now the dominant cross-family payer
- hash still carries the hidden `KEYINDEX` load cluster
- array still carries numeric-key control loads
- the refreshed owner map did not expose a new target outside the reject pile

## Freeze-Point Truth-Pack Decision

The newest focused truth pack answered the next gating question directly:

- steady-state trace and exit activity is still materially nonzero after
  warmup
- value-only hash:
  - `TRACE_START 10`
  - `TRACE_ABORT 9`
  - `TEXIT_COUNT 960000`
- key-using hash:
  - `TRACE_START 10`
  - `TRACE_ABORT 9`
  - `TEXIT_COUNT 640000`
- array value-only control:
  - `TRACE_START 12`
  - `TRACE_ABORT 10`
  - `TEXIT_COUNT 960000`

So the remaining red is not yet just compiled-loop throughput. The next
justified target is still root-trace or side-trace ownership on the frozen
baseline, starting from the exact steady-state exit site for value-only hash.
This is not permission to reopen bridge work, no-guard families, or backend
micro-surgery.

Focused follow-up on `kdz` narrowed that site further:

- a post-warmup `jit.dump` `texit` probe on value-only hash shows repeated
  `TRACE 1 exit 1`
- the matching `jit.dump=is` root trace places that seam in the early root
  snapshot region ahead of the visible value-lane add path
- this is an inference from snapshot ordering, but it means the next target is
  the early hidden-control/root-ownership seam, not the visible value lane and
  not a late backend add/compare rewrite

The next focused read sharpened the ownership split:

- value-only hash measured phase:
  - one successful extra trace: `trace 2`
  - `trace 2` is `linktype=stitch`
  - all observed texits still stay on `1:1`
  - the next attempted owner is `trace 3`
  - `trace 3` aborts as `inner loop in root trace`
- array value-only control measured phase:
  - `exit 1` does promote to a live side trace
  - observed texits are overwhelmingly on `5:1`, with only a small residual
    count on `4:1`

So the next justified target is:

- explain why hash `exit 1` remains root-owned while array `exit 1` promotes to
  a live side trace

The newest focused classifier makes that statement more specific:

- the current hash/array split is partly enforced by recorder policy in
  [src/lj_record.c](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/src/lj_record.c):
  payload descendants behind iterator `exit 1` are widened automatically only
  for numeric-key iterators
- enabling `LUAJIT_S390X_ALLOW_ITER_DESC=1` on the frozen `kdz` baseline proves
  that this policy is one real cause of the hash `2/1` abort loop
- but it is still not a landing direction:
  - hash then forms a ladder of tiny root traces
  - those traces still stop back into the same owner path
  - those new hash roots still link back to `trace 1`, not to the loop owner
  - array’s promoted roots link back to the loop owner instead
  - and they still execute the same expensive hidden-control plus `ADDOV`
    body

So the current live seam is not “make hash descendants legal again” in the
abstract. It is:

- find out what keeps hash from promoting into a materially different owner
  body and owner link once descendants are allowed
- or conclude that there is no remaining promotable root/side ownership cut on
  the current mechanism

The newest source-level read narrows that again:

- the first stop target is chosen earlier, in `rec_loop_jit()` inside
  [src/lj_record.c](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/src/lj_record.c)
- later child-link promotion in
  [src/lj_trace.c](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/src/lj_trace.c)
  can only refine a stop choice that already exists
- a focused direct classifier with `LUAJIT_S390X_ALLOW_ITER_DESC=1` also shows
  that descendant permission alone does not recreate the earlier array
  promoted-owner shape; both hash and array can collapse to a `link=1`
  root-ladder in that simplified surface

So the next target is now:

- explain why the default array path reaches a different `rec_loop_jit()`
  stop target and trace family than hash

  - still shows:
    - `int VLOAD 0005 #0`
    - `int SLOAD #3 T`
    - `int ADDOV`
  - and no extra visible value-lane frame `SLOAD`

## What Is Rejected

These are not active perf candidates anymore:

- full-lazy collapse
- any `KEYINDEX` no-guard path
- direct `KEYINDEX` tag-word compare
- backend dedup of `KEYINDEX` guard generation
- hidden-control carry through the unused visible-key slot
- body-scan loopback overrides as landing policy
- `TRACE 2` churn elimination as a perf proxy
- bridge-local producer and consumer fusion
- exact `rec_itern()` accumulator preloads that still leave the root trace on
  `int SLOAD #3` plus `ADDOV`
- accumulator-to-`num` cuts that still keep the loop-unroll `int.num` check
- backend `AR/SR` overflow rewrites
- backend `AGFR/CGFR` equality-guard rewrites

The common failure modes were:

- semantic breakage
- cross-host regression
- same-host pinned `kdz` regression
- or real structural change with no promotable hot-loop win

## Current Gate Result

The one remaining accumulator-family pass was tried and rejected.

- Exact experiment:
  - preload the exact iterator accumulator slot from `rec_itern()` as a real
    `num` `SLOAD`
  - add the minimal s390x `num-from-int` `IRSLOAD_CONVERT` path needed to
    support that slot load
- Structural result:
  - rejected immediately
  - raw IR on `kdz` still showed:
    - `int SLOAD #3`
    - `int ADDOV`
  - the carried slot was not actually born as `num`
  - the back-edge `int.num` problem therefore was not removed
- Decision:
  - there is no remaining justified accumulator-family pass from the current
    mechanism
  - do not reopen that family unless a future cut can prove the original
    carried slot becomes `num` before `loop_unroll()` sees it

The one allowed backend classifier also came back negative:

- the surviving hash `sload_keyindex` / `sload_type` cluster does not lower as
  a plain load + compare + branch sequence
- current lowering in
  [src/lj_asm_s390x.h](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/src/lj_asm_s390x.h)
  is a load + tag-extract shift + compare + branch sequence
- there is no narrow semantic-preserving load/test or compare/branch fusion
  candidate visible from the current lowering

## Future Entry Gate

Do not start another iterator perf patch unless all of these are true first:

- a named remaining payer exists
- there is a direct structural proof target in raw IR or low-noise logs
- the idea is not already in the reject pile
- the candidate can be tested against this exact measured branch-tip `kdz` baseline with
  `zkd0` used only as a regression screen

Current status against that gate:

- the checkpoint truth pack is complete on `kdz`
- the minimal checkpoint regression screen is complete on `zkd0`
- the owner map is refreshed
- the next open question is now narrower:
  - why does hash `exit 1` remain root-owned while array `exit 1` promotes to
    a live side trace?
- there is still no justified new code-level perf patch until that site is
  identified cleanly

Acceptable future target shapes:

- one new recorder/live-in idea that removes a remaining root-trace
  storage/control read
- one new semantic-preserving lowering idea only if it targets an actually
  fuseable sequence, not a hoped-for micro-op win

Unacceptable future target shapes:

- anything whose main claim is “fewer backend instructions”
- anything whose proof is only “the IR looks cleaner”
- anything that depends on bridge or continuation policy

## Promotable Patch Gate

A future iterator patch is promotable only if it:

- keeps value-only hash, key-using hash, and array control micros green
- beats the measured branch-tip `kdz` baseline
- does not regress `zkd0`
- removes a real steady-state payer in IR or low-noise logs
- does not rely on branch-shape churn or late backend micro-surgery
