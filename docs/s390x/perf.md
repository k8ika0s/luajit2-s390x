# s390x Performance Status

Last updated: 2026-03-31 09:12:31 PDT

## Scope

This page tracks the current native s390x performance state after the branch
was frozen into three lanes:

- Lane A: build and stability only
- Lane B: promotable recorder-side iterator perf only
- Lane C: parked bridge and continuation research only

The current performance frontier is Lane B only. The bridge and continuation
line is parked unless the clean no-probe iterator baseline regresses
semantically again.

## Authoritative Validation Surfaces

- Primary perf host:
  - `kdz:/root/luajit2-s390x/perf-clean-20260330/repo`
  - machine type `8561` (`z15`)
- Regression screen host:
  - `zkd0:/root/luajit2-s390x/perf-clean-20260330/repo`
  - machine type `3906` (`z14`)

Validation rules:

- tracked-file sync only
- direct `src/` rebuild only
- same-host pinned `kdz` A/B is the policy signal
- `zkd0` is regression-only
- low-noise manual logs or debugger only
- no dirty-tree `iterator_probe.py` runs for perf decisions

## Frozen Iterator Baseline

The current promotable iterator perf baseline is the four-piece recorder split
in [src/lj_record.c](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/src/lj_record.c):

- array visible numeric key comes from successor index:
  - `HIOP(trvk) - 1`
- non-array visible key stays lazy
- hash table live-in is trusted and read-only in `rec_isnext()` / `rec_itern()`
- non-array value lane is seeded from `ix.val` so the hash root trace no longer
  frame-source the visible value slot

This is a split policy, not a full-lazy collapse.

## Current Pinned Baseline

Pinned `kdz` baseline on the frozen four-piece split:

- `pairs_sum/hot median=0.059818`
- `pairs_array_sum/hot median=0.061622`

`zkd0` regression screen on the same baseline:

- `HASH_VALUE 3000`
- `HASH_KEY 1320`
- `ARRAY_VALUE 3000`
- `pairs_sum/hot median=0.093881`
- `pairs_array_sum/hot median=0.087945`

These are the numbers new iterator perf work must beat.

## What The Current Baseline Proved

- The branch is no longer blocked on the old late crash in dispatch helper
  errno handling.
- Array and hash do not pay the same owners.
- Array-side post-call numeric key-lane waste was reduced by deriving the
  visible numeric key from the successor index instead of rereading the helper
  tuple key lane.
- Hash-side eager visible-key and table-slot costs were both removed.
- Hash root traces no longer frame-source the visible value lane.
  - helper `VLOAD #0` now feeds the hash add path directly
  - the old extra frame value `SLOAD` is gone

## Current Owner Map

Low-noise manual logging and raw IR on the frozen baseline show:

- Value-only hash:
  - dominant shared payer is still `addov_rr_int_eq`
  - main non-value cluster is still the hidden `KEYINDEX` load
  - only other frame `SLOAD` is the carried total slot
  - helper `VLOAD #0` feeds the visible value lane directly
- Key-using hash:
  - still pays shared `addov_rr_int_eq`
  - still pays the hidden `KEYINDEX` load
  - adds a visible key/type `SLOAD`
- Array value-only control:
  - still pays shared `addov_rr_int_eq`
  - still pays numeric-key control loads

Current read:

- shared `addov_rr_int_eq` is now the dominant cross-family payer
- hash still carries the hidden `KEYINDEX` load cluster
- array still carries numeric-key control loads

## What Is Rejected

These are not active perf candidates anymore:

- full-lazy collapse
- any `KEYINDEX` no-guard path
- direct `KEYINDEX` tag-word compare
- backend dedup of `KEYINDEX` guard generation
- hidden-control carry through the unused visible-key slot
- body-scan loopback overrides as landing policy
- `TRACE 2` churn elimination as a perf proxy
- bridge-local producer and consumer fusion
- exact `rec_itern()` accumulator preloads that still leave the root trace on
  `int SLOAD #3` plus `ADDOV`
- accumulator-to-`num` cuts that still keep the loop-unroll `int.num` check
- backend `AR/SR` overflow rewrites
- backend `AGFR/CGFR` equality-guard rewrites

The common failure modes were:

- semantic breakage
- cross-host regression
- same-host pinned `kdz` regression
- or real structural change with no promotable hot-loop win

## Current Gate Result

The one remaining accumulator-family pass was tried and rejected.

- Exact experiment:
  - preload the exact iterator accumulator slot from `rec_itern()` as a real
    `num` `SLOAD`
  - add the minimal s390x `num-from-int` `IRSLOAD_CONVERT` path needed to
    support that slot load
- Structural result:
  - rejected immediately
  - raw IR on `kdz` still showed:
    - `int SLOAD #3`
    - `int ADDOV`
  - the carried slot was not actually born as `num`
  - the back-edge `int.num` problem therefore was not removed
- Decision:
  - there is no remaining justified accumulator-family pass from the current
    mechanism
  - do not reopen that family unless a future cut can prove the original
    carried slot becomes `num` before `loop_unroll()` sees it

The one allowed backend classifier also came back negative:

- the surviving hash `sload_keyindex` / `sload_type` cluster does not lower as
  a plain load + compare + branch sequence
- current lowering in
  [src/lj_asm_s390x.h](/Users/kaitlyndavis/dev/github.com/k8ika0s/luajit2-s390x/src/lj_asm_s390x.h)
  is a load + tag-extract shift + compare + branch sequence
- there is no narrow semantic-preserving load/test or compare/branch fusion
  candidate visible from the current lowering

## Future Entry Gate

Do not start another iterator perf patch unless all of these are true first:

- a named remaining payer exists
- there is a direct structural proof target in raw IR or low-noise logs
- the idea is not already in the reject pile
- the candidate can be tested against this exact frozen `kdz` baseline with
  `zkd0` used only as a regression screen

Acceptable future target shapes:

- one new recorder/live-in idea that removes a remaining root-trace
  storage/control read
- one new semantic-preserving lowering idea only if it targets an actually
  fuseable sequence, not a hoped-for micro-op win

Unacceptable future target shapes:

- anything whose main claim is “fewer backend instructions”
- anything whose proof is only “the IR looks cleaner”
- anything that depends on bridge or continuation policy

## Promotable Patch Gate

A future iterator patch is promotable only if it:

- keeps value-only hash, key-using hash, and array control micros green
- beats the frozen pinned `kdz` baseline
- does not regress `zkd0`
- removes a real steady-state payer in IR or low-noise logs
- does not rely on branch-shape churn or late backend micro-surgery

## Benchmark And Logging Commands
